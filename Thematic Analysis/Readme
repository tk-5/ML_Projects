Folder that contains code for Approach#2 - theme detection based on summarization and mining of co-occurrence networks

Create_Corpus.ipynb : 
code for creating a corpus from a set of json files

Summarize_corpus.ipynb : 
code for reading articles from json fies -> generating extractive summary of each article -> saving the entire summary data as 
a single corpus.
                        
Improvised_Cooccurrence_N_grams_base.ipynb :    
Implements theme identification without filtering them based on any domain. working as same as mentioned below without the 
domain filtering part.

Improvised_Cooccurrence_N_grams_domainFiltering.ipynb :
Main code file. It requires a text corpus created either by Create_Corpus.ipynb Or by Summarize_corpus.ipynb.
After reading the corpus it does pre-processing - tokenization , stop word removal, ngram addition, lemmatization.
Then it performs LDA (topic modelling)
In this code we extract bigger output from LDA (30 topics) then we perform domain based filtering (set of domains need 
to be specified by the user in the code) and get the topics which qualify to be in selected domains.
To implement domain filtering - an extension to Wordnet is used which supplies word-> Domain filtering.

To make the code work the code of the above mentioned repository has to be put into the directory as the Improvised_Cooccurrence_N_grams_base.ipynb

It then makes co-occurrence network from the topics derived from domain filtering
then it generates n-grams (up to 5 gram) by mining the co-occurrence network.
