Folder that contains code for Approach#2 - theme detection based on summarization and mining of co-occurrence networks

Create_Corpus.ipynb : 
code for creating a corpus from a set of json files

Summarize_corpus.ipynb : 
code for reading articles from json fies -> generating extractive summary of each article -> saving the entire summary data as 
a single corpus.
                        
Improvised_Cooccurrence_N_grams_base.ipynb : 
Main code file. It requires a text corpus created either by Create_Corpus.ipynb Or by Summarize_corpus.ipynb.
After reading the corpus it does pre-processing - tokenization , stop word removal, ngram addition, lemmatization.
Then it performs LDA (topic modelling)
It makes co-occurrence network from the topics derived from LDA
then it generates n-grams (up to 5 gram) by mining the co-occurrence network.
